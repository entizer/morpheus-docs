- Tenants
- ANP's
- EPGâ€™s
- Contexts
- Bridge Domains
- Filters
- Contracts

Once ACI is integration to a cloud, it can be used during instance provisioning:

#. From the EPG drop down, either an existing EPG can be selected or a new one can be created. It is the same for ANP, either create a new one or choose an existing.
#. Under ACI security consumes and provides, contracts can be searched when you enter a name. When the provisioning wizard is completed, it will provision the instance and apply the ACI options and Security. This can be viewed under the instance page, or via REST API and CLI.

- In a Blueprint, you can define the ANP and EPG of each Tier
- Variables can be used for EPG and ANP names.
- This could be useful to create blueprints for dev testing to isolate from prod networks.
- This can be hybrid based on the VMM domains in APIC.
