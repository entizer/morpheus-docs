New Features
============

:Amazon: - Added KMS KEY ID field in provisioning Advanced Options sections for specify an AWS KMS key for encrypting EBS Volumes during provisioning when volume encryption is enabled
         - Asia Pacific (Seoul) ap-northeast-2 region added

:Azure: - Select Availability Zones during Instance, App, and Cluster provisioning. Select "Availability Zone" from the "Availability Options" menu and then specify the appropriate Availability Zone from the additional field that appears in the wizard

:Clusters: - Added "Install Docker" checkbox to the Add Cluster Layout modal. When checked, Docker is installed and when left unchecked, |morpheus| assumes Docker is already installed or will be installed via Workflows or some other means
           - :ref:`New 20.1 & 20.2 Cluster Layouts seeded<k8s>`

:Google: - Added sync for Service Accounts and the ability to select a service account when provisioning Instances, Blueprints and Apps, Clusters and Hosts to Google Clouds. Once the Resource Pool is selected, the available service accounts are synced and the dropdown menu to select them appears
         - When provisioning to the default service account for the selected resource pool, an additional Access Scope option is presented. Users can opt to allow default access or to allow full access to all cloud APIs
         - |morpheus| will now onboard live cost data from GCP, see `GCP integration guide <https://docs.morpheusdata.com/en/5.3.3/integration_guides/Clouds/google/google.html#enabling-live-costing-for-gcp>`_ for configuration details
         - Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) support added for creating, managing, discovering and provisioning to GKE Kubernetes Clusters.
         - Seoul Region Added

:Hosts: - Deleting a Host or VM (Infrastructure > Hosts) with “Remove Associated Instances” marked and “Remove Infrastructure” unmarked is now handled differently. Host records and A records are no longer removed and teardown-phase Tasks are not run. If the Cloud is configured to inventory existing resources, the host or VM will be synced back in as a unmanaged resource on the next cloud sync :superscript:`5.2.9`

:Huawei Cloud: - EIP billing mode changed to bill by traffic rather than bandwidth. Note that this change does not affect OTC Clouds which only bill by traffic :superscript:`5.2.9`

:Kubernetes: - Deactivated all 1.17 Cluster Layouts (no longer supported by k8s)
             - Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) support added for creating, managing, discovering and provisioning to GKE Kubernetes Clusters.
             - :ref:`New 20.1 & 20.2 Cluster Layouts seeded<k8s>`
             - Added support for either or both token and kubceconfig on external kube clusters

:Library: - Added Ubuntu 20 Layouts for nearly all supported Clouds :superscript:`5.2.9`
          - Added Debian 9 and 10 Layouts for VMware Clouds to the standard Morpheus Library :superscript:`5.2.9`
          - Added CentOS 8 (7.9, 8.3, 8.4) images for nearly all Cloud types
          - Added Rocky 8 images for VMware, Amazon, Google, Nutanix, OpenStack, DigitalOcean (and more) Cloud types
          - Added OpenSUSE 15 images for all compatible Clouds
          - Added Windows Server 2016 and 2019 images for Azure and Google Clouds
          - Disabled several deprecated System Instance Types and associated Layouts that are no longer maintained: **Cassandra, Confluence, Devstack, Hadoop, Jboss, Jenkins, Magento, Mongo, Moogsoft, Nexus, Percona, Puppet, RethinkDb, Riak, RiakCs, Stash, Solr, Wordpress, and Zookeeper**. NOTE: this only disables the Instance type from the system seeded library and does not affect user created Insatnce Types or Layouts. :superscript:`5.2.9`

:Logs: - Splunk and LogRhythm integrations removed from Administration > Settings > Logs

:Migrations: - Migrations UI (under the Tools menu) is deprecated and removed

:Network: - Added a Display Name field for networks, this value appears as the network name on the network display page (Infrastructure > Network). For synced networks, the name and display name will initially be identical but users can edit the display name if it makes sense to present a friendlier name to users :superscript:`5.2.9`
          - Added ability to change network during an Instance reconfigure (Select Reconfigure from the Instance Actions menu) for Instances in VMware and OpenStack Clouds. In other Clouds, network is still a read-only field during Instance reconfigure :superscript:`5.2.9`

:OpenStack: - Create, modify, and delete OpenStack Projects (Resource Pools) from Cloud detail pages
            - Added option to specify an OpenStack project at provision time through the Resource Pool dropdown menu. This option is available when provisioning Instances, Apps, and Clusters
            - Support for v2 Identity API was deprecated in 5.2.9 and has been dropped for this release

:Packages: - New ``/administration/packages`` component added targeted for uploading future |morpheus| provided mpg's, however users will be able to create, distribute and/or import custom |morpheus| packages. Additional information on creating custom packages will be provided.
           - New Role permission ``Admin: Packages`` (None, Full) added. Allows or disallows access to the Packages tab on the Integrations page (Administration > Integrations)

:Profiles: - New ``Profiles`` component added to Clouds with ``Terraform Profile`` and ``Key/Value Profile`` types. Profiles give users the ability to create custom object associated secrets and metadata that will automatically be mapped during provisioning and automation.
           - Terraform Profiles allow created cloud associated tfvars secrets, allowing tf apps and specs to be provisioned across multiple clouds that required different tfvars.
           - Key/Value Profiles expand provisioning, automation, billing and reporting capabilities by allowing dynamic custom object specific metadata in provisioning and automation mappings using ``<%=cloud.profile.key%>``

:ServiceNow: - Optimized CMDB sync performance to significantly reduce sync times for large cmdb record sets.
             - ServiceNow Multi-Domain (domain separation) Support added. Note: Requires upcoming plugin version

:Terraform: - Added UI feedback and status indication when refreshing Terraform Instance state (:guilabel:`REFRESH STATE` button or "Refresh State" selection from Instance Actions menu)
            - Added support for ``count`` and ``for_each`` loops
            - ``terraform`` command line added to State tabs for executing tf cli commands with execution output
            - Added cloudConfig.agentInstall variable for adding agent install script to tf. Example: ``<%=instance?.cloudConfig?.agentInstall%>`` can be used in userdata section of an aws_instance
            - Custom Options can now be used in tf library configs. For example, option types  can be set on tf layouts or associated Instance Types and <%=customOptions.key%> used tf.

:UI: - Added more detailed help block text for the Private Key field when storing a new key pair in Morpheus (Infrastructure > Keys & Certs > Key Pairs) :superscript:`5.2.9`
     - Execution and history tabs: Execution output is now limited on initial load to 10k characters per event with an option to load the full output for each event
     - Help text added to Add Integration modals warning that HTTP URLs are insecure and not recommended

:vCloud Director: - System administrator account credentials can now be provided to authenticate vCD Cloud integrations in |morpheus|. Previously, only organization administrator credentials could be used. Keep in mind that you will need to set the system administrator account credentials appropriately, for example, to be able to see entities created by the organization administrator
                  - Added the option to specify a catalog to store |morpheus|-provisioned artifacts, previously |morpheus| would always create and use a "morpheus_auto" catalog

:VDI: - VDI pools can now be configured to be "Recyclable". When enabled, the VDI Instance will revert back to a snapshot and become available once again after the user has logged out and the VDI session has expired. This behavior will not apply to VDI pools which are also configured to be persistent because in that configuration the Instance is merely stopped and saved for the user's next session. This feature is currently only available for Cloud types which support snapshot management (VMware, Nutanix, and vCD)
      - Improved image streaming in low bandwidth situations


:VMware vCenter: - Added support for VMware Content Library. |morpheus| automatically on-boards items from your content library and re-syncs them regularly to keep them up to date. Add images from the |morpheus| library to Node Types for use in Layouts and Instance Types
                 - The UUID for hypervisor hosts synced into vCenter Clouds is now stored to the ``unique_id`` field on hypervisor host ``compute_server`` records :superscript:`5.2.9`
                 - Improved sync performance for VMware Resource Pools and Folders :superscript:`5.2.9`
