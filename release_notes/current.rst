|morphver| Release Notes
*************************

.. IMPORTANT:: This release includes improvements to Amazon AWS price sync. After upgrading, it's recommended that you manually perform one "Daily" refresh of one of your Amazon Clouds to ensure availability of Amazon pricing data. To manually refresh a Cloud, navigate to Infrastructure > Clouds > (Selected Amazon Cloud) and select "Daily" from the REFRESH dropdown menu. If this is not done, |morpheus| may not show Amazon pricing information in the provisioning wizard until the following day after an automatic Daily refresh would have taken place.

.. NOTE:: Items appended with :superscript:`5.x.x` are also included in that version
