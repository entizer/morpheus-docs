New Features
============

- Ansible Tower: Added Inventories tab to Ansible Tower integration detail pages (Administration > Integrations > Selected existing Ansible Tower integration) to surface inventories by name and allow for configuration related to Tenant defaults
- Ansible Tower: Added Tenant default execution of Ansible Tower Jobs. Tower Jobs created in the Master Tenant can be set to Tenant default execution mode which, when shared and run in a Subtenant, ensures the Job is automatically run against inventories associated with the Tenant of execution
- Ansible Tower: Associate default inventories with |morpheus| Tenants from the inventory permissions menu (Administration > Integrations > Selected Ansible Tower integration > Inventory tab > MORE menu > Permissions). When executing a Tower Job and selecting the Tenant Default inventory mode, the inventories associated with the Tenant are automatically selected
