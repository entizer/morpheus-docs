EKS Clusters
------------

Provisions a new Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Cluster in target AWS Cloud.

.. note:: EKS Cluster provisioning is different than creating a Kubernetes Cluster type in AWS EC2, which creates EC2 instances and configures Kubernetes, outside of EKS.

|morpheus| currently supports EKS in the following regions: ``us-east-2``, ``us-east-1``, ``us-west-1``, ``us-west-2``, ``af-south-1``, ``ap-east-1``, ``ap-south-1``, ``ap-northeast-3``, ``ap-northeast-2``, ``ap-southeast-1``, ``ap-southeast-2``, ``ap-northeast-1``, ``ca-central-1``, ``eu-central-1``, ``eu-west-1``, ``eu-west-2``, ``eu-south-1``, ``eu-west-3``, ``eu-north-1``, ``me-south-1``, ``sa-east-1``, ``us-gov-east-1``, ``us-gov-west-1``
