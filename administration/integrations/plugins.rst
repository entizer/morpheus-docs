Overview
^^^^^^^^

|morpheus| is extendable with custom plugins for Task types, UI tabs, approvals, cypher, and more. Plugins are added from the Plugins tab of the Integration page under Administration (|AdmIntPlu|). Simply browse for a local plugin file (.jar) to add it to the UI. Custom plugins can also be deleted by clicking on the trash can icon in the corresponding row.

Please visit the `Morpheus Developer Portal <https://developer.morpheusdata.com>`_ for Plugin Architecture SDK documentation and help getting started with custom Plugin development.
