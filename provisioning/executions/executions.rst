Executions
----------

Executions contains the execution status and history from Task and Operational Workflow Executions run from Library > Automation > Tasks and Library > Automation > Workflows. Executions for Tasks and Workflows are split out to their own labeled tabs.

.. note:: Tasks and Workflows executed from a Job or from Instance or Host ``Actions`` do not populate in the Executions Section, and can be referenced from the History tab on the target resource. All task and Workflow executions can be referenced in ``Operations > Activity > History``

 .. note:: Job and automation executions can be expanded to show process details by clicking on the arrow icon immediately to the right of the `NAME` column.
