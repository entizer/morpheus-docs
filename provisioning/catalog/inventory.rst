Inventory
---------

The Inventory Page reveals the complete list of items which have been ordered by the user and provisioned. Users will only see their own items in this section.

Inventory Detail
----------------

Access the detail page for an item in your inventory by clicking the View Details link. The page displayed will look very similar to an Instance or App detail page in the Standard Persona. Highly detailed information on the health of the Instance or App are shown here. We can also take actions against Instances such as running Tasks or Workflows, reconfiguring the Instance, controlling the power state, and more.
