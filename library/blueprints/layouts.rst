Layouts
-------

Layouts are attached to Instance Types. A Layout can only be attached to a single Instance Type and a single Technology. An Instance Type can have one or many Layouts attached to it, allowing for a single Instance Type to work with any Technology type. Node Types are added to Layouts. A Layout can have one or many node types attached to it. Node types can be shared across Layouts of matching Technology types.

.. important:: Once an Instance Type is defined on a Layout and saved, the Instance Type setting and Technology selections on the Layout cannot be changed.
