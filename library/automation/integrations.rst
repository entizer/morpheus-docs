Integrations
------------

The Integrations section in ``Provisioning -> Automaton -> Integrations`` is for adding and managing Automation Integrations. Existing Automation Integrations from ``Administration -> Integrations`` are also populated and accessible from ``Provisioning -> Automaton -> Integrations`` and vice-versa.

``Provisioning: Automation Integrations`` and ``Admin: Integrations`` are separate Role permissions, so Automations Integration access can be separated from the Administration Integrations section.

Automation Integrations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 - Ansible
 - Ansible Tower
 - Chef
 - Puppet
 - Salt

.. note:: Automation integrations can be added and managed in ``Administration -> integrations`` as well. Adding and editing Integrations in ``Provisioning -> Automaton -> Integrations`` and ``Administration -> Integrations`` are the same dataset and additions and updates are reflected in both sections.

.. note:: Role access for ``Integrations: Ansible`` determines user access to Ansible Integration detail page, which contains Ansible command line and execution access.
